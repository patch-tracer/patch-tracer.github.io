# README

This folder contains the breadth dataset and depth dataset in our empirical study.

##### Breadth Dataset

We built a breadth dataset of OSS vulnerabilities by acquiring all open source vulnerabilities from $DB_A$â€‹ and $DB_B$â€‹ as of April 7, 2020. We obtained 8,630 and 5,858 CVEs from $DB_A$â€‹ and $DB_B$â€‹â€‹ respectively. 

#####  Depth Dataset

For each CVE, two of the authors separately found its patches by analyzing patches reported by the three databases, looking into CVE description and references in NVD, and searching GitHub repositories and Internet resources. Then, they exchanged sources and ways to find patches. After that, another author participated in. They investigated inconsistent cases together, and revisited all CVEs for several rounds until reaching a consensus. Finally, they successfully found patches for 1,295 CVEs.

##### Update

We have made the datasets publicly available. And We hope it can be a basis for follow-up researches, which require accurate mapping between CVEs and patches.

If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to report an issue. We will continue to maintain these datasets. So many thanks for your feedbackðŸ˜„.
